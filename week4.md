# Week 4
This week was mostly about finishing the backend of the application which I was able to do. Right now I'm just waiting on my other teammates to finish their parts of the project. It was mostly a slow week.
I would say that the project is about 70% done. This was kind of expected for me because I already have experience working on a project like this.

What I accomplished this week:
- Creating the Flask server.
- Implementing the OpenAI API implementation.
- Finding a Speech to text API for voice transcription

Biggest Challenges of the week:
-  The Biggest challenge I had this week was mostly just getting past the CORS error in the front end this seems to always be a reoccuring problem whenever I develop a project locally
-  Finding a speech-to-text API that didn't cost money was also a challenge because these services are in high demand
-  Another issue I encountered was getting outdated documentation for Chattgpt whenever I encountered any issues so I had to resolve  it on my own.
