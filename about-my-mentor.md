Under his leadership, DEPA collaborates with prestigious organizations such as the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Army Research Laboratory, NASA, and the Department of Homeland Security. The lab also partners with Purdue Universityâ€™s Visual Analytics for Command, Control, and Interoperability Environments (VACCINE), a DHS Center of Excellence, to tackle complex problems in data analytics and predictive modeling. Dr. Nyarko was my faculty mentor for the CEAMLS program, where his expertise and support were instrumental in my research journey. His guidance provided me with valuable insights and helped me develop the skills necessary to excel in my project. Working with Dr. Nyarko was an enriching experience that not only expanded my knowledge but also inspired me to pursue further research in the field.
