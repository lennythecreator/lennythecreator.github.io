Week 6 was mostily about prepating for the mid point presentation which invloved going over the different slides of the proesentation 
and how to delivery the information in the most appropriate manner. 

What I accomplished this week:
- Practiced my presentation skills to feel more confident and engaging.
- Tweaked the slides to make sure they were clear and visually appealing.
- Rehearsed the presentation flow to keep everything logical and smooth.
- Got feedback from peers and mentors and made some adjustments based on their input.
- Concentrated on the key points to clearly communicate the project's core objectives and progress.
