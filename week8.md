### Research Paper Completion
This past week, I finished up my part of our research paper, diving into the software development methods we used. I laid out all the steps we took and the choices we made to make sure everything ran smoothly.

### Chatbot Response Testing
Besides writing, I spent some time testing our chatbot to see how well it responds. The goal was to make sure it gives accurate and supportive replies. I ran a bunch of tests to fine-tune its capabilities.

### Prompt Writing and LLaMA3 Model Testing
I also teamed up with a friend to work on writing better prompts for our models. We wanted to improve the quality of the inputs. Plus, we tested the LLaMA3 model, checking its performance and making tweaks for better results.

All in all, it was a pretty productive week with lots of progress in our research and development. Stay tuned for more updates!
