This week I assisted in the data annotation of the sampled dataset of sentences gotten from the trascript. This involved using the Go-Emotion model to assign emotions to the different sentences in the dataset. I also discussed with my teammate about how we can implement RAG into our application. This is going to be alot more intersting because the Rag Implementation would make our chat bot stand out from others.

### What I accomplished this week:


- Discussed with my teammate the potential implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in our application.
- Explored how RAG can enhance our chatbot's performance by allowing it to retrieve and generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses.
- Identified the unique features RAG will bring, making our chatbot stand out from others in the market.
- Outlined next steps for integrating RAG into the application.
- Set milestones to track our progress and ensure timely completion of tasks.
- Prepared to test and evaluate the RAG-enhanced chatbot to measure its effectiveness and user satisfaction.
